Here are the codes used for the project entitled "Cell motility enhances metabolic interactions in spatially structured microbial communities"
The paper is close to submission. 
The packages include two folders:
-"Expcodes" contains the Mathematica codes used for experimental data analysis. The input is the datasets generated from the analysis of Microscopic images using Midap: https://github.com/Microbial-Systems-Ecology/midap. 
-"Simcodes" contains the Mathematica codes used for the individual-based simulations, as well as the subsequent analyses.
